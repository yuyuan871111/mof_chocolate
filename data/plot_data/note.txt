1. Some genus would be separated to two parts, which represents that they are two different results from the two different scientists. 
For example: Anaerobaculum : 5.4-8.7 (6.6-7.6)
would be separated to
Anaerobaculum(1) : 5.4-8.7
Anaerobaculum(2) : 6.6-7.6

2. 'Cell size width(um)' only can be adjusted up to 5. If the value is larger than 1, it doesn't mean the precise value but the value larger than 1 .
